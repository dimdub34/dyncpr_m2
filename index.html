                            <li>Common Pool Resources (CPRs) are resources that are non-excludable but rivalrous, like fisheries, groundwater basins, forest etc.</li>
                            <li>CPRs are subject to the <i>Tragedy of the Commons</i> (Hardin 1968), that leads to over-extraction and depletion of the resource.</li>
                            <li>This tragedy is not inevitable, as shown by Ostrom's work on economic governance of the commons.</li>
                            <li>Behavioral and experimental economists have also made contributions and found mechanisms that can help to mitigate the tragedy and reduce the over-exploitation, like :
                                <ul style="font-size: 0.75em">
                                    <li><strong>Communication</strong>: Allowing users to communicate can lead to more cooperative outcomes.</li>
                                    <li style="margin-top: 5px"><strong>Sanctions</strong>: Implementing penalties for overuse can deter individuals from over-exploiting the resource.</li>
                                    <li style="margin-top: 5px"><strong>Property Rights</strong>: Assigning property rights to the resource can give individuals or groups an incentive to manage it sustainably.</li>
                                    <li style="margin-top: 5px"><strong>Regulation</strong>: Government regulations or quotas can limit the use of the resource and prevent over-exploitation.</li>
                                    <li style="margin-top: 5px"><strong>Nudges</strong>: Behavioral interventions, or "nudges", can influence individuals' decisions and promote more sustainable use of the resource.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>CPRs have mainly been studied in a static framework: the resource is assumed to be fixed and unchanging over the course of the game. Players make decisions about how much to extract from the resource but theses decisions do not affect the future availability of the resource.</li>
                            <li style="margin-top: 30px">However in reality many CPRs are dynamic : they regenerate over an infinite horizon of time and the extraction decisions made by players can affect the future availability of the resource.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Our research dives into this dynamic framework, investigating the behavioral component in the CPR management over time.</p>

						<h4>Dynamic framework</h4>

							<li>The resource evolves over time :
                                <ul>
                                    <li>$H_{t+1}$ depends on $H_t$, $w_t$ and R where $H$ is the resource level, $w$ the extraction and $R$ the regeneration.</li>
                                    <li>The resource regenerates
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Additive regeneration : constant rate of natural growth (rain for example), fixed amount of the resource is added each instant.</li>
                                            <li>Multiplicative regeneration : the amount added to the resource depends on the current level of the resource.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The time horizon is infinite, which allows to study the long-term effects of extraction decisions on the resource and the sustainability of different strategies.</li>

                            <li>We calculated the score of each subject and based on this measure we defined two groups depending on whether the subject was below (low) or above (high) the median score.</li>
                            <li>Each pair was therefore composed of either low-low, low-high or high-high members</li>

                                        <li><strong>Avoidance of Social Sanctions:</strong> Conforming to descriptive social norms can help avoid social disapproval.</li>

                        <h4>Discretization</h4>
                        <p>
                        For the discretization of the continuous-time model, we consider $\tau$ as the discretization step and $n$ as a period. Time is discretized into intervals of length $\tau$, such that the differential equation and the payoff are approximated in each interval $n\tau , (n + 1)\tau$.

                        <h4>Injunctive Social Norm</h4>
                        <p>
                            Injunctive Social Norms are norms that people perceive as being approved or disapproved by others. They are rules or behaviors that individuals feel they are supposed to follow in a given context, often because they believe that others think they should behave in a certain way. In the context of nudges, an Injunctive Social Norm nudge provides information about what is generally approved or disapproved in a particular situation, thereby influencing individuals' behavior.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The theoretical paths serve as a normative guide or standard that indicates the "ideal" or "approved" behavior in the given context. By showing the subjects what the optimal extraction path looks like, we are essentially communicating a normative message about what they "should" do to achieve the best possible outcome.
